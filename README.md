### Project Description
UNIverse is a comprehensive campus utilities platform that integrates essential student services into one beautiful, animated web application.UNIverse brings together lost & found, attendance tracking, event management, real-time chat, and bus schedules in a single, easy-to-use interface.

### The Problem statement
Students across campuses struggle with fragmented services - lost items go unreported, attendance tracking is manual and error-prone, important events get missed, communication is scattered across multiple platforms, and bus timings are hard to find. This leads to inefficiency, missed opportunities, and a disconnected campus community.

### The Solution
UNIverse solves this by providing a centralized, real-time platform where students can report and find lost items with image uploads, predict attendance shortage risks, stay updated on campus events, communicate in a common chat room, and access bus schedules instantly. All features are backed by Firebase for real-time synchronization and data persistence, wrapped in an engaging, bubbly UI that makes campus life sweeter.
